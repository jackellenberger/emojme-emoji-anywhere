# Slack Emoji Anywhere - Chrome Plugin

What if your slack emoji came with you on any webpage you went to? What if you could type :buttbrowdotpng: in your github commit and see ![buttbrowdotpng](https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T7ZGGRLGN/buttbrowdotpng/d923b0305524f93e.gif), just as sassy as you intended? That's a world I want to live in. Now you can too!

## Todo

* prevent emoji from being applied to text boxes
* Add support for emoji composition, i.e. typing ":buttbr" and getting :buttbrow:
  * add slack emoji picker while typing
  * add ability to choose between plaintext `:emoji:`, `![mardown](emoji.png)` and `<img src="emoji.png" alt="html>`
  * [omnibox](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/user_interface#omnibox) for emoji search?
